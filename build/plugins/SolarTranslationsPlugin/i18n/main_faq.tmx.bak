		RAID is a Redundant Array of Independent Disks. RAID allows storage of data on several linked 
disks that are recognized as a single entity by server operating system. Solar Communications provides
several RAID SATA and SAS configurations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
RAID-0:  Uses block-level striping and has no redundancy. RAID-0 provides improved performance and
additional storage but no fault tolerance as the technology divides data into blocks and places each block
on a different drive. This solution is most effective for applications where speed is of the primary concern.
As RAID-0 does not provide redundancy daily backups are strongly recommended.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
RAID-1: Uses mirroring where data is written identically to 2 disks. The application continues to operate
as long as at least one drive is functioning. RAID-1 offers high degree of redundancy at a minimal
performance reduction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
RAID 5 : Uses block-level striping with distributed parity. RAID-5 distributes parity along with the data and
requires all drives but one to be present to operate. Upon drive failure, the data can be restored as enough
data has been made redundant. This is an optimal solution for databases and solutions that require high disk 
utilization. We recommend this solution due to combination of data protection and speed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
RAID-1 + Hot Spare: This type of RAID is great if one of your drives fail and you need to replace it without 
shutting down your system. Hot Spare is a hard disk that is switched into operation if one of the hard drives 
in RAID-1 fails. This way you always have 2 working hard drives at your disposal.</seg>

As RAID-0 does not provide redundancy daily backups are strongly recommended.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
RAID-1: Uses mirroring where data is written identically to 2 disks. The application continues to operate
as long as at least one drive is functioning. RAID-1 offers high degree of redundancy at a minimal
performance reduction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
RAID 5 : Uses block-level striping with distributed parity. RAID-5 distributes parity along with the data and
requires all drives but one to be present to operate. Upon drive failure, the data can be restored as enough
data has been made redundant. This is an optimal solution for databases and solutions that require high disk 
utilization. We recommend this solution due to combination of data protection and speed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
RAID-1 + Hot Spare: This type of RAID is great if one of your drives fail and you need to replace it without 
shutting down your system. Hot Spare is a hard disk that is switched into operation if one of the hard drives 
in RAID-1 fails. This way you always have 2 working hard drives at your disposal.</seg>

		RAID ist Redundante Anordnung unabhängiger Festplatten. RAID ermöglicht die Speicherung von Daten auf mehreren miteinander verbundenen
Festplatten, die als eine Einheit von Server-Betriebssystem erkannt sind. Solar Communications bietet
mehrere RAID SATA-und SAS-Konfigurationen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
RAID-0: Verwendet Striping auf Blockebene und hat keine Redundanz. RAID-0 bietet eine verbesserte Leistung und
zusätzlichen Speicher, aber keine Fehlertoleranz, wie die Technologie teilt Daten in Blöcke und platziert jeder Block
auf einem anderen Laufwerk.Diese Lösung ist am effektivsten für Anwendungen, bei denen Geschwindigkeit der Hauptanliegen ist.
Als RAID-0 bietet keine Redundanz, sind tägliche Backups dringend empfohlen.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
RAID-1: Verwendet Spiegelung, wo die Daten identisch zu 2 Festplatten geschrieben sind. Die Anwendung arbeitet weiter
solange mindestens ein Laufwerk funktioniert. RAID-1 bietet hohe Redundanz bei minimalem
Leistungsreduzierung.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
RAID 5: Verwendet Block-Level Striping mit verteilter Parität. RAID-5 verteilt Parität zusammen mit den Daten und
verlangt, dass alle Treiber vorhanden sein, um zu arbeiten. Nach Festplattenausfall, können die Daten wiederhergestellt werden als genug
Daten wurde entlassen. Dies ist eine optimale Lösung für Datenbanken und Lösungen, die hohe Auslastung von Festplatten erfordern.
Wir empfehlen diese Lösung aufgrund der Kombination des Datenschutzes und der Geschwindigkeit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
RAID-1 + Hot-Spare: Diese Art von RAID ist toll, wenn einer Ihrer Treiber ausfällt, und Sie müssen, um es ohne
Herunterfahren des Systems zu ersetzen. Hot Spare ist eine Festplatte, die in Betrieb geschaltet wird, wenn eine der Festplatten
in RAID-1 ausfällt. Auf diese Weise haben Sie immer 2 Arbeits-Festplatten zur Verfügung.</seg>
