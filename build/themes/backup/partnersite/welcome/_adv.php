              One of the key elements of success in IT is the infrastructure. Cloudcom worked really hard to build and equip an extraordinary privately-owned platform and as a result we got an entire platform where the machinery, network and software are our property and this eliminates potential risks connected with leasing of the equipment and adds yet another level of security to our network.
